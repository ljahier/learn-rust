# Learning Rust with some small projects

* [print-multiplication](https://github.com/ljahier/learn-rust/tree/master/print-multiplication) - Print multiplication tables up to 10
* [fizz-buzz]() - Count to 100 and print "Fizz" if the number is a multiple of three, "Buzz" for multiples of five and if is multiple of three AND five print "FizzBuzz"
